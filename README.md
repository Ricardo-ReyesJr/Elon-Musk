# Elon-Musk
This is a tribute practice page.
I did this tribute page while learning to code with html and css using freecodecamp.org. This was completely a learning project, where I had to do all the work. No tutorial or copy-paste code. simple beginner learning project. I will need to work on making more front-end and full-stack websites.
