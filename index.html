          <p id="tribute-info">Here I am writing about Elon Musk and tributing the good things he has done. Elon is helping move society forward into the future. He has put out there all the information about electric vehicles. All the information Tesla is open source. He doesn't care if another company can take that information and make things better than he had. Even if it means he could go bankrupt. He just want society to succeed.</p>
